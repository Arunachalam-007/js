    <p><q><i>Excellence is a continuous process and not an accident.</i></q>- A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</p>

    <p>Abdul Kalam had to struggle a lot to reach the success he has achieved in his career.<br>
         He has been a live manifestation of the strength he describes in this quote.<br>
          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam or A.P.J Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October, <br>
          1931 to a humble Tamil Muslim family. He had to sell newspapers his his childhood in order to<br>
           manage the finances of the family. He was an average student in school but his keen interest <br>
           in studies and his hard work are what helped him achieve success in his career.</p>
    <p>Kalam graduated in Physics from Tiruchirapalli’s St Joseph’s College, <br>
        which was affiliated with the University of Madras, in 1954. In the year 1955, <br>
        Kalam pursued Aerospace Engineering from Madras Institute of Technology.<br>
         Kalam wanted to become a fighter pilot for IAF but missed the opportunity as there were only <br>
         eight positions and Kalam qualified ninth.</p>

        <p>Kalams journey to become the <b><q>missile man of India</q></b> had its trials and <br>
            tribulations and yet he attained his goal because of his singleminded devotion. <br>
            After he completed his engineering, he joined DRDO’s Aeronautical Development Establishment as a scientist. <br>
            He also designed a helicopter for the Indian Army in the beginning of his career.<br>
             Kalam was still not sure of his career choice.<br>
             In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). <br>
             In ISRO, he headed the project of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III).<br>
              The growth of Kalam began here from a mere scientist to become the missile man of India itself.<br>
               He headed several successful launches and started gaining recognition in relevant circles.</p>

   <p>Kalam was the chief executive of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme.<br>
     Under this mission, Kalam helped to develop Agni and Prithvi missiles. <br>
     Kalam was also the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Secretary of DRDO and to the Prime Minister. <br>
     The Pokhran-II tests were conducted in the same period.<br>
      These subsequent successes made Kalam one of the most popular scientists in media.</p>

      <h2>A Tribute from India to Dr Kalam</h2>
      <p>India plans to pay a great tribute to late Shri APJ Abdul Kalam.
